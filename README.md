meandmymonkey/satis-silex
=========================

A static [Satis](https://github.com/composer/satis) repository
in a Docker container with all packages for a vanilla
[Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) install.

Please note that a static, non-updateable Satis repo is almost
certainly not what you want in real life (I use this for
workshops teaching things that involve composer installs).
